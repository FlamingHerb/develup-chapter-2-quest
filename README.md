# ðŸš€ Lost Voyager: Asteroid Destroyer
Inspired by a rather acquainted game from HunsterVerse, **Lost Voyager: Asteroid Destroyer** is a retro-styled reverse shoot-em-up game where _you_ create your own obstaclesâ€”literally! Become the master of dodging your own meteor-creations (no pun intended), boosting your way out or slowing down time sexy-style.  And maybe brag to your friends that you're just a bit more better than them in Touhou (this is not a valid claim).

This game is made for DevelUP's application processâ€”specifically its Chapter 2 Main Quest.

## Mechanics added in this game as stated by the guidelines:
- Hitpoints (One Life, literally)
- Movement (2D Top-Down)
- Time-sensitive Mechanic (Last Score Chance, Boost/Slowdown)
- Drops/Resources (Bomb Mechanic, Boost/Slowdown)
- Spawning/Respawning (Meteors)
- Overworld Hazards/Obstacles (Meteors)
- And possibly a lot more since I have no idea how many more mechanics I added in this game.
